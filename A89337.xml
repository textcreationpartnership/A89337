            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firſt, the Generall Verdict of Antiquity, as well Doctrinall as Hiſtoricall: though we ſhould not name that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> conſiſting of 630 Fathers, which by one Canon decreed it to be a Sacriledge to preſſe downe a Biſhop into the degree of a Presbyter. The ſame Councell that did alſo ordaine another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which was then the very break-neck of Romiſh Popedome. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, The Authenticall Texts of Scripture ſo farre as thereby to demonſtrate Chriſt his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Epiſcopall Prelacy after his Aſcenſion in the Churches of <hi>Aſia:</hi> in one whereof without all contradiction was one <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Biſhop and Martyr.</p>
            <p>As for the Churches, whereof we are to ſpeake; The Tractate hath beene undertaken in behalfe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, which practice at this day the ſame Prelacy under theſe two divers names of Epiſcopacy and Superintendency, as much exceeding the number of thoſe which are deſtitute of Biſhops, yet ſo, as juſtly condemning the Romiſh Hierarchy (rather Tyranny) poyſoned with moſt groſſe Idolatry, and not ſo onely, but ſo farre oppoſite to the Epiſcopacy which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that it is a falſe Uſurpation, that all Biſhops be originally deduced from the Pope, and dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Other Churches deſtitute of Biſhops we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from, yet not ſo (farre be it from us) as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them eſſentiall Churches of Chriſt, but to
<pb facs="tcp:155210:3"/> whom, as formerly, we doe deſirouſly give the right hand of Brotherly fellowſhip; to joyne againſt the Common and grand adverſary in the Romiſh <hi>Babylon.</hi>

            <p>As for you (good Chriſtian Reader) his hope is, that he ſhall not need the uſe of the Apoſtles Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſaying, <hi>Am I your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> and his prayer to God ſhall be to protect and bleſſe you, to the Glory of his ſaving Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, that he alſo will diſtribute to this our lacerated Church ſome portion of that his peerleſſe Legacy left unto his Apoſtles, when he ſaid, <hi>My peace I leave with you,</hi> by vertue whereof we may with one Heart and Mind faithfully Worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth.</p>

               <p>We begin with the Prophecy. The Prophecy was onely,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:155210:16"/> that there ſhould be in time to come, <hi>a contention about the word Biſhop.</hi> If we ſhould aske our Oppoſites, when this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was firſt knowne in times of old, they would be loth to tell us, knowing right well, that it was firſt rayſed by one <hi>Aërius,</hi> of whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> have<note n="*" place="margin">See above.</note> told us, that he broke out into Schiſme, and<note n="*" place="margin">See above.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he could not obtaine to be made a Biſhop,</hi> did therefore ſpurne againſt Epiſcopacy, teaching, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin, that there ought to be no difference betweene Biſhops and Presbyters;</hi> therefore thus they may ſee the Prophecy fulfilled, both when, and in whom, if they like it. But if any ſhall boaſt, that it is fulfilled now by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Oppoſalls againſt Epiſcopacy, after that it hath had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation with a continuall uſe univerſally in the Churches of God: then have we nothing elſe to reply, but what the ſpirit of God, from the pen of the holy Apoſtle, putteth in our mouth; <hi>If any be contentious</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, nor the Churches of God,</hi> whereby the wilfully conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious maketh himſelfe an adverſary to the Churches of God, and conſequently no way acceptable to God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond poynt which we are to diſcerne, is that, which they call identity of names of Biſhops and Presbyters: they ſhould have called it community of names, eſpecially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is no more identity in the words <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> then there is betweene the letters of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> but this was a lapſe; Therefore to our matter in hand. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that meere names and words make but verball conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, to which we oppoſe a reall and Logicall conſequence <hi>à paribus,</hi> thus; for of the very Apoſtles of Chriſt one inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe <hi>Co-presbyter,</hi> another himſelfe <hi>Presbyter,</hi> a third himſelfe <hi>Deacon,</hi> who are all common names with others that were not Apoſtles; and notwithſtanding; the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in reſpect of their Offices and Functions were Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over Presbyters, which ſheweth that the enterchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of names cannot conclude an indifferency of degree. But this <hi>crambe</hi> will be ſodden once againe, when we ſhall be occaſioned to give further ſatisfaction. As for the preſent, it may well be ſaid, <hi>what ſhall we need words, when we ſee acts

                  </gap> agreeth with the word <hi>cenſus</hi> in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by whom it appeareth, that it was a cuſtome in Apoſtolicall Churches to make a Role (for this word he held not unfit) of the Order of Biſhops to bring them unto their firſt originall, even as, ſaith <hi>Tertullian, Polycarpus</hi> was from <hi>John</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking even of this our <hi>Clemens,</hi> and

                     <hi>Meade</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his other ſayings more obvious unto me, to ſhew, that he hath not beene rightly underſtood by theſe obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours. For <hi>Collectively,</hi> properly taken, is a word compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a multitude without diſtinction of perſons, as Chriſt in his Lamentation ſayd, <hi>O Hieruſalem, how oft would I have gathered Thy Children, but Thou wouldſt not]</hi> where the words ſingular <hi>Thou, and Thy,</hi> doe here comprehend all the Citizens of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> without diſtinction.

If that our Objectours had (according to Maſter <hi>Meade's</hi> direction) but call'd to minde his owne explanations, they might have eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he ſaid no more, then as if we may grant that under the word Angell, to whom the Epiſtle is in ſpeciall directed, are implyed all thoſe who are concern'd therein. But how? not by alteration of his perſon, but by communion of intereſt, for which cauſe Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledged him the <hi>Preſident</hi> over others, even as many other Proteſtant Divines are ready to doe, and that as exactly as either we can deſire, or our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites miſlike, when we come to diſcharge the affirmative poynt.</p>
                  <p>Two Anſwers we wiſh our Oppoſites to take into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:155210:25"/> thoughts; One, as they have preſented him by way of compariſon, as <hi>better skill'd</hi> in the Booke of the Revelation then his adverſary: the other, as he is to be ſingly reſpected, and in his owne worthineſſe. To the firſt we ſay, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon might well have beene forborne, which now provoketh us to another compariſon, betweene him and one as deare to our Oppoſites as any other, whom they know to have beene as converſant in the Booke of the Revelation altogether, wherein he, notwithſtanding, after the ſecond and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hath beene ſo farre from the collective interpretation of the word Angell, that he hath not any where, as we can find, ſet it downe as comprehendnding any Multitude, nay in many places he expreſſeth by name the individuall perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſome <hi>Individuum Vagum</hi> ſignified thereby, ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular notable one.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of Maſter <hi>Meade</hi> his worthineſſe and judgement touching Epiſcopacy, would be had the rather, becauſe we have read the Tranſlation of his Booke authoriz'd in this manner, <hi>It is Ordered by the Committee of the Commons Houſe in Parliament, that the Booke entituled, the Key of the Revelation, be Printed.</hi> So they. Which key doth unlock unto us his judgement in behalfe of Epiſcopacy, to be ſo fully according to the word of God, that part. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 67. <hi>p.</hi> 35. <hi>The foure and twenty Elders</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>compaſſe next about the throne, which repreſent the Biſhops and Prelates of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and doe anſwer both in place and order to the Levites and Prieſts in the Camps of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Thus Maſter <hi>Meade,</hi> ſo commended by our Oppoſites themſelves, who if they ſhall approve his Key in this poynt, it is well, we in imparting thus much unto them have but done our duty.</p>

                     </note> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, that the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches, but he ſaith not likewiſe that the ſeven Starres are the ſeven Angells, but in mentioning Angells omitteth the word ſeven, which is not done without a Myſtery, to wit, that the Angells doe not ſignifie ſeven Individuall Paſtours. So they. Whoſe Tenents are two; Firſt, that the omiſſion of the word Seven argueth a Myſtery; Secondly, that the Myſtery ſignified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is this, <hi>that the word Angell is not individually, but collectively taken.</hi> We cannot but deny both, and ſo will any even with wonderment at the Objectours boldneſſe in uttering ſuch their conceptions: for firſt to call that a Myſtery, which by all Grammar learning is in every Language moſt common, by that which the Grecians call <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is a word not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed following upon courſe in the underſtanding of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Reader. As for example: If any one of our Oppoſites writing to any of his Servants to bring him his two Horſes,

                  <p>Secondly, Were it that a Myſtery ſhould be imagined therein, yet that denyall of the word Angel, to be an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall perſon in the Text, contradicteth the Context.

Who would not have thus argued, if they had conſidered; that by thus oppugning our Expoſition, they have as utterly undermin'd and overthrowne their own. As for example, their tenent hath beene; that, by the word Angel is ſignified the <hi>Order and Colledge of Paſtours,</hi> in the Church of Epheſus: Now then (to returne their owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine upon them) if the Candleſticke, ſignifying the Church, ſhould be removed out of its place, except thoſe Paſtours ſhould repent, then ſhould the people and congregation be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the fault of thoſe Paſtours.

               <p>In the ſecond place, we doe appeale to the Texts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to give a ſufficient taſt; for oftentimes the Angells are reckoned ſeven, and after diſtributed ordinatively into firſt, ſecond third, and ſo till the ſeventh, as plainly as one can reckon the ſeven dayes in the Weeke, Chap. 15. &amp; 16. Afterwards we have recited one Angell having the Key of the bottomleſſe pit, Chap. 20. was there need of a Collectively underſtood multitude of Angells to keepe one Key? The like may be ſaid of a mighty Angell for delivering a little booke, Chap. 10.1, 2. Beſides the Angell whom <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to have worſhipped, Chap. 22. will they ſay this Angell alſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a Multitude? then might the Angell reply, have you forgot when I ſaid to <hi>John, I am thy fellow Servant,</hi> but five words, and every one an Individuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to returne to the queſtioned Texts, whereas ſome of the Angells are commended for notable vertues, and as much condemned for ſome notorious vices; they that thinke that all the ſame vices and vertues did as well imply every Paſtour in all the Colledges of the ſeven Churches may as well conceive, that where the deformities are noted in any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,

Firſt from the words of the Chap. 1.1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt ſent by his Angell to his Servant John</hi>] to acknowledge the Epiſtles to have beene dictated by Chriſt himſelfe, conveied by an Angell to <hi>John,</hi> and as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the ſecond and third Chapters, diſtributed by <hi>John</hi> to the ſeverall Angells, and communicated to the Churches. After this, by the vertue of the ſame letters, an inquiſition is made, (as it were a Viſitation kept) upon every Angell of the Churches, concerning the diſcharge of their offices; wherein two of them are found of weight and commendable, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five, more or leſſe criminally delinquents, yet ſo; as to manifeſt a juſtification of the offices. The approbation of the function is ſeene, not onely (which reaſon none can deny) by Chriſt his commending their <hi>diligence, zeale, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> but even likewiſe in his proceſſe of <hi>convictions, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and denuntiations</hi> againſt their <hi>remiſſeneſſe, diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and faithfulneſſe</hi> of others; but how? certainly, ſo that the condemnation of their vices and abuſes argued an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their Offices and Functions becauſe it was done not with an abſolute intent to remove them at the firſt, but onely to reforme them, and continue them upon their Reformation; therefore was it ſaid from Chriſt to one, <hi>Repent, or elſe, &amp;c.</hi> Chap. 2.5. &amp; 16. to another, <hi>Repent, if not, I will come againſt thee,</hi> and the like; this we ſee was no deprivation of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at firſt, much leſſe abolition of the Offices which were to continue from age to age.</p>
               <p>The laſt poynt will be our Aſſumption from all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:155210:31"/> which is, that theſe Angells, being ſo amply, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſo unanimous conſent of the moſt and beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Proteſtant Divines, agreeable to Hiſtoricall practiſe of Apoſtolicall Churches, proved to have beene ſuch Biſhops as had a Prelacy over the Clergy with Chriſts owne appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, a truth, which the evidence of theſe Scriptures did expreſſe in part from<note n="(a)" place="margin">Beza de Miniſt. grad. cap. <hi>13.</hi> Quid objicis in aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Johannis Apoſt.

            <head>The Apoſtolicall Inſtitution of EPISCOPACY; deduced out of the premiſes, by <hi>W. C.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we abſtract from Epiſcopall government all accidentals, and conſider onely what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and neceſſary to it; we ſhall finde in it no more but this. An appointment of one man of eminent ſanctity and ſufficiency to have the care of all the Churches, within a certaine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct or Dioceſſe; and furniſhing him with authority, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or arbitrary, but regulated and bounded by lawes, and moderated by joyning to him a convenient number of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. To the intent that all the Churches under him may be provided of good and able Paſtours: and that both of Paſtours and people conformity to lawes and performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be required, under penalties, not left to diſcretion, but by law appointed.</p>
            <p>To this kinde of government I am not by any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſo devoted, as to thinke it ought to be maintained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in oppoſition to Apoſtolick inſtitution, or to the much deſired reformation of mens lives, and reſtauration of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſcipline, or to any law or precept of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt: for that were to maintaine a meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end. for obedience to our Saviour is the end for which Church Government is appointed. But if it may be demonſtrated, or made much more probable then the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as I verily thinke it may: I. That it is not repugnant to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:155210:45"/> the government ſetled in and for the Church by the Apoſtles. II. That it is as complyable with the reformation of any evill which we deſire to reforme either in Church or State, or the introduction of any good which we deſire to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as any other kind of government: And III. That there is no law, no record of our Saviour againſt it: then I hope it will not be thought an unreaſonable motion, if we humbly deſire thoſe that are in authority, eſpecially the High Court of Parliament, that it may not be ſacrificed to clamour, or overborne by violence: and though (which God forbid) the greater part of the multitude ſhould cry, <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie,</hi> yet our Governours would be ſo full of Juſtice and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as not to give it up untill they perfectly underſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Epiſcopacy it ſelfe, <hi>Quid mali fecit.</hi> I ſhall ſpeake at this time onely of the firſt of theſe three points: That Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy is not repugnant to the government ſetled in the Church for perpetuity by the Apoſtles. Whereof I conceive this which followes as cleare a demonſtration, as any thing of this nature is capable of.</p>
            <p>That this government was received univerſally in the Church, either in the Apoſtles time, or preſently after, is ſo evident and unqueſtionable, that the moſt learned adverſaries of this government do themſelves confeſſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrus Molinaeus</hi> in his booke <hi>De munere paſtorali,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely written in defence of the Presbyteriall government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth: That preſently after the Apoſtles times, or even in their time (as Eccleſiaſticall ſtory witneſſeth) it was ordained, That in every Citie one of the Presbytery ſhould be called a Biſhop, who ſhould have preeminence over his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; to avoid confuſion which oft times ariſeth out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality. And truely this forme of government all Churches every where received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodorus Beza</hi> in his Tract <hi>De triplici Epiſcopatus genere,</hi> confeſſeth in effect the ſame thing. For having diſtinguiſhed Epiſcopacy into three kinds, <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and <hi>Satanicall,</hi> and attributing to the ſecond (which he calls <hi>Humane,</hi> but we maintaine and conceive to be <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi>) not onely a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:155210:45"/> priority of order, but a ſuperiority of power, and authority over other Presbyters, bounded yet by lawes and canons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt Tyranny: he clearely profeſſeth, that of this kind of Epiſcopacy is to be underſtood whatſoever we read concerning the authority of Biſhops or Preſidents (as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> calls them) in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and other more ancient Writers.</p>
            <p>Certainely from<note n="*" place="margin">To whom two others alſo from <hi>Geneva</hi> may be added: <hi>Daniel Chamie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> (in Panſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, tom. 2. lib. 10. cap. 6. §. 24) and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. Vedelius</hi> (Exercitat. 3. in epiſt. Ignatii ad Philadelph. cap. 14. &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. 8. in epiſt. ad Mariam, cap. 3.) which is fully alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, in the former Treatiſe, by the teſtimonies of thoſe who wrote in the very next age after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> theſe two great defenders of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we ſhould never had this free acknowledgement, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to their owne pretence, and ſo advantageous to their adverſaries purpoſe, had not the evidence of cleare and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable truth enforced them to it. It will not therefore be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpend any time in confuting that uningenuous aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Anonymus Authour of the Catalogue of Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for the equality of Biſhops and Presbyters, who affirmes, That their diſparity began long after the Apoſtles times: But we may ſafely take for granted that which theſe two learned Adverſaries have confeſſed; and ſee, whether upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation layed by them, we may not by unanſwerable reaſon raiſe this ſuperſtruction.</p>
            <q>That ſeeing Epiſcopall Government is confeſſedly ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ſo Catholique, it cannot with reaſon be denyed to be Apoſtolique.</q>
            <p>For ſo great a change, as betweene Presbyteriall Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Epiſcopall, could not poſſibly have prevailed all the world over, in a little time. Had Epiſcopall Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beene an aberration from, or a corruption of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment left in the Churches by the Apoſtles, it had beene very ſtrange, that it ſhould have beene received in any one Church ſo ſuddainly, or that it ſhould have prevailed in all for many Ages after. <hi>Variâſſe debuerat error Eccleſiarum: quod autem apud omnes unum eſt, non eſt erratum, ſed tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Had the Churches err'd, they would have varied. What therefore is one and the ſame amongſt all, came not ſure by errour, but tradition. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from the conſent of the Churches of his time, not long
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:155210:46"/> after the Apoſtles, and that in matter of opinion much more ſubject to unobſerv'd alteration. But that in the frame and ſubſtance of the neceſſary government of the Church, a thing alwayes in uſe and practice, there ſhould be ſo ſuddaine a change as preſently after the Apoſtles times, and ſo univerſall, as received in all the Churches, this is clearely impoſſible.</p>
            <p>For what univerſall cauſe can be aſſigned or fained of this univerſall Apoſtaſie? you will not imagine that the Apoſtles, all or any of them, made any decree for this change, when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they were dying. This were to grant the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. To wit, that the Apoſtles, being to leave the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches themſelves, and either ſeeing by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, or fore-ſeeing by the Spirit of God, the diſtractions and diſorders which would ariſe from a multitude of equalls, ſubſtituted Epiſcopall government inſtead of their owne. Generall Councells to make a Law for a generall change, for many ages there was none. There was no Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, no coërcive power over the Church to enforce it. Or if there had beene any, we know no force was equall to the courage of the Chriſtians of thoſe times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not then learn't to fight for Chriſt) but their obedience to any thing againſt his law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learn't to dye for him.) Therefore there was no power then to command this change; or if there had beene any, it had beene in vaine.</p>
            <p>What deviſe then ſhall we ſtudy, or to what fountaine ſhall we reduce this ſtrange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to thinke, that all the Presbyters and other Chriſtians then, being the Apoſtles ſchollers, could be generally ignorant of the will of Chriſt, touching the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Presbyteriall government? Or dare we adventure to thinke them ſo ſtrangely wicked all the world over, as againſt knowledge and conſcience to conſpire againſt it? Imagine the ſpirit of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had entered into ſome or a great many of the Presbyters, and poſſeſſed them with an ambitious deſire
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:155210:46"/> of a forbidden ſuperiority, was it poſſible they ſhould attempt and atchieve it once without any oppoſition or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and beſides that the contagion of this ambition ſhould ſpread it ſelfe and prevaile without ſtop or controule, nay, without any noyſe or notice taken of it, through all the Churches in the world; all the watchmen in the meane time being ſo faſt aſleepe, and all the dogges ſo dumbe, that not ſo much as one ſhould open his mouth againſt it? But let us ſuppoſe (though it be a horrible untruth) that the Presbyters and people then were not ſo good Chriſtians as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are now, that they were generally ſo negligent to retaine the government of Chriſts Church commanded by Chriſt, which we now are ſo zealous to reſtore: yet certainly we muſt not forget nor deny that they were men as we are. And if we looke upon them but as meere naturall men, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by experience how hard a thing it is even for policy arm'd with power by many attempts and contrivances, and in a long time to gaine upon the liberty of any one people, undoubtedly we ſhall never entertaine ſo wild an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that among all the Chriſtian Presbyteries in the world, neither conſcience of duty, nor love of liberty, nor averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from pride and uſurpation of others over them, ſhould prevaile ſo much as with any one, to oppoſe this pretended univerſall invaſion of the Kingdome of Chriſt and the liberty of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>When I ſhall ſee therefore all the Fables in the <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> acted and prove ſtories; when I ſhall ſee all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraties and Ariſtocraties in the world lye downe and ſleep, and awake into Monarchies: then will I begin to believe that Presbyteriall government, having continued in the Church du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Apoſtles times, ſhould preſently after, againſt the Apoſtles doctrine and the will of Chriſt, be whirl'd about like a ſcene in a maſque, and transformed into Epiſcopacy. In the meane time, while theſe things remaine thus incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and in humane reaſon impoſſible; I hope I ſhall have leave to conclude thus. Epiſcopall government is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:155210:47"/> to have beene univerſally received in the Church, preſently after the Apoſtles times. Betweene the Apoſtles times and this preſently after, there was not time enough for, nor poſſibility of ſo great an alteration. And therefore there was no ſuch alteration as is pretended. And therefore Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, being confeſſed to be ſo ancient and Catholique, muſt be granted alſo to be Apoſtolique. <hi>Quod erat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrandum.</hi>
